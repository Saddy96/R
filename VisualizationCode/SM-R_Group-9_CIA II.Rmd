# Use Case --------------------------
  #Air Quality Index report has to be provided to Environmentalist for the analysis of various pollutants 
  # resulting to the pollution for different cities across India. Using the data provided we are analyzing
  # the different variables and its effect on the target variables that is Air Quality Index and formulating
  # the strategies required to improve the pollution levels.

# Business Problem ---------------------
  # To get an estimate of the air quality index across multiple cities by measuring the quantity of 
  #  particulate matter and other harmful pollutants in the air. 

# OBJECTIVES ----------------------------
# 1. To identify the cities that are most and least polluted.
# 2. To assess the air quality index of the cities
# 3. To determine the extent to which the harmful pollutants are present in the air.
# 4. To check the air quality across a span of years in the mentioned cities.
# 5. To analyze the effect of independent variables on the target variable.

# Data Exploration --------------------------------

#DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES:
#1. When the temperature is high, nitrogen and oxygen combine together and form various
  # different oxides. Nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are the most abundant.
  # NOx is a combination of Nitrogen monoxide and Nitrogen dioxide.

#2. Nitric oxide is not hazardous in a typical ambient environment. But if 
  # there is excess Nitric oxide in the air, it may cause respiratory ailments,
  # hematologic side effects, metabolic disorders, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

#3. NOx can be formed due to different reactions. Nitrogen oxides are formed mainly 
  # during lightning strikes. Nitrogen oxides are also produced from fuel combustion
  # in automobiles. Stationary emission from coal-fired power plants and electric power
  # boilers also produces Nitrogen oxides. Its from smog and acid rain. The impact of
  # NOx on human health include damage to lung tissue, breathing and respiratory problems.

#4. The atmosphere is often polluted because of particles. These particles are often 
  # floating dust or particulate matters. Particulate matters are seen in different 
  # sizes based on their diameters: the bigger particles, the easier it to wash away.
  # The finer particles stayed for a long time in the atmosphere and transported over a
  # long distance. PM10 and PM2.5 are two types of particulate matter which are
  # increasing day by day, causing air pollution. When you breathe, these particles
  # penetrate into the lungs quickly and causes cough and asthma, high blood pressure,
  # heart attack, strokes etc. which can lead to premature death. High PM2.5 can also
  #increase air mist and fog, which reduces visibility.

#5. Ozone pollutant is not emitted but created by chemical reactions between
  # nitrogen oxide and a volatile organic compound. This reaction happens when
  # pollutants are emitted by cars, power plants, industries, etc. chemically
  # react in sunlight. It can be transported long distances by wind. People most at 
  # risk due to the ozone in the atmosphere include people with asthma, children, older
  # adults and people who do a lot of outdoor activity.

#Interpretations of the Report:
  # 1. The data profiling Report describes that there is no missing data in the
    # dataset, the total observation is 99,776.
  
  # 2. we have 19% of discrete columns, 81% of continuous columns and we don't
    # have missing columns or observations in the data, Data structure derives
    # 6236 observation of 16 variables.

  # 3. The uni-variate Distribution histogram for all the pollutants is right
    # skewed. we have two categorical variables which is represented in bar
    # chart it says that hyderabad has noted highest responses followed by delhi.

  # 4. AQI categories observations is noted in order Moderate has the highest
    # followed by Satisfactory, poor, good, very poor, Severe.

  # 5. Q-Q PLOT(Quantile â€“ Quantile) tells about the normal distribution of
    # pollutants PM10 & AQI has highest observations.

  # 6. The correlation analysis for entire data tells that it is a positive right
    # skewed data, C6H6 & O3 have very less correlation & AQI-(PM2.5 & PM 10) have
    # the highest correlation.

  # 7. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used for identification
    # of a smaller number of uncorrelated variables states we have 11 principal
    # components that PC1 is 26% , PC2 is 34.1% and PC11 is 77.7%.

#Interpretations:
# The top four pollutants responsible for pollution are nitric oxide, 
  # sulphur dioxide, particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10.
  # Their average presence in air is 32.45, 11.514,61.33 and 123.42, respectively.
  # The majority of the observations recorded on a specific day fall into the 
  # Moderate (2521) or Satisfactory (2079) category. However, there are 124
  # observations and 410 observations recorded for the Severe and Very poor
  # Air Quality Index.

    # In 2016, Hyderabad had a poor air quality index. In 2017, 2018, 2019 and
    # 2020, Delhi again had peak pollution with the maximum number of observations

# CONCLUSION:--------------------
  # From this dataset of 6236 observations, we found that there are certain cities
    # like Delhi and Hyderabad that have been affected by various pollutants like
    # PM2.5, PM10, and NOx. The pollution levels are different corresponding to
    # different years. Based on the inferences from the data, certain
    # strategies have been formulated along with the ethical, social, and
    # societal issues that the firms face in daily life.

# STRATEGIES:----------------------------
  # 1. If the company utilizes harmful pollutants in its manufacturing processes,
      # the company should also organize regular green drives in an attempt to
      # improve the quality of the air.

  # 2. After the identification of priority pollutants, the company has to identify
      # the measures to control sources of pollution and to implement control measures.

  # 3. Such companies that emit harmful pollutants into the atmosphere must be
      # situated away from the residential areas.

  # 4. To design programs that reduce air pollution from the company's
      # own operations and also from the suppliers.

  # 5. To tighten and regulate the emission standards for the companies.

  # 6. Specifically in Delhi, the most polluted city, the concentration of NO2
      # is higher so the government must place a cap on the NO2 emissions in the
      # state in order to keep the air quality index under control.

  # 7. In Hyderabad, there is a higher concentration of PM 2.5 so the companies
      # in Hyderabad must install chimneys to reduce the particulate matter emissions.

# ETHICAL ISSUES:-----------------
  # 1. Lack of transparency by companies in clearly mentioning the
      # details about their emissions to society.

  # 2. Non-compliance of norms by the companies engaged in harmful emissions
      # by situating their premises in the residential areas due to
      # lack of availability of space.

  # 3. The setting of conflicting goals by the companies in managing air pollution.

# SOCIETAL ISSUES:-----------------
  # 1. PM2.5 is considered harmful for human health and this has a direct
      # impact on the health of the citizens at large especially the vulnerable
      # sectors of the society that are more prone to the respiratory illnesses
      # caused by air pollution.

  # 2. Air pollution also has an impact on renewable energy which in turn affects
      # society at large. Due to the prevalence of smog caused by harmful
      # pollutants, the sunlight cannot fully penetrate and it reduces the
      # solar panels energy output.

# SOCIAL ISSUES:-----------------
  # 1. The surge in harmful emissions by companies across the cities have
      # reached alarming levels and this is a major cause of climate. Climate
      # change is being manifested by an increase in temperatures, ozone layer
      # depletion and global warming.

  # 2 Air pollution harms cognitive functioning across all life stages,
      # from prenatal development to childhood, to adulthood, and even into old age.
